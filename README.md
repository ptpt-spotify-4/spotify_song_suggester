Contributions:

* Carl Stimson
Built most of the Flask dashboard, including the HTML templates. This comprised landing and 
results pages for the visualization and prediction features. Set up the Spotify API and helped 
figure out how to pull data from it. Worked with Lucas in creating the functions in modules.py 
and predict.py to process data and provide output for display on a browser. Collaborated with 
Unit 4 members to understand, troubleshoot, and integrate the model.
